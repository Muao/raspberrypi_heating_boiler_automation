solution 1

sudo nano /etc/rc.local
add string:
#set pause for database can initialize
sleep 10
#run jar
java -jar /home/pi/bau-jar-with-dependencies.jar
before 'exit 0' string


solution 2
1.add new script to /etc/init.d/ with any name (bau)

start-->
#!/bin/bash

sleep 10
UP=$(pgrep mysql | wc -l);
echo 'mysql is running: $UP' >>/var/log/messages
echo $UP >>/var/log/messages
echo 'bau-jar-with-dependencies.jar starting..'  >> /var/log/messages
java -jar /home/pi/bau-jar-with-dependencies.jar
exit 0

end-->
echo commands needs for writing to log file. You can find this messages with the command:
cat /var/log/messages | grep "sql" -A 1 -B

2. make it executable
sudo chmod +x bau

3. create link to folder with your runlevel
sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/bau /etc/rc5.d/S02bau

4. check your runlevel with command 'runlevel'.
You can set needs runlevel via 'sudo raspi-config'

reboot and enjoy

solution 2 was created on search how to run jar after db init.
